# Web-server
This repo integrates Github actions and AWS services for a full CI/CD pipeline to launch a web server application.

The tools used are:
- Python (Fastapi, Pytorch, Jinja2)
- Docker
- AWS (ECS, ERC)

The current application allows uploading an image and classify which object it contains.
